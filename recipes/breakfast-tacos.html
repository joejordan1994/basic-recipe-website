<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Breakfast tacos represent an exquisite morning indulgence, where soft tortillas envelop a medley of fluffy scrambled eggs, crisped bacon or savory chorizo, and slices of creamy avocado. A sprinkle of aged cheddar or queso fresco introduces a touch of richness, while a drizzle of vibrant salsa or a dollop of sour cream adds a refreshing contrast. Each bite weaves together the simplicity of ingredients with a complexity of flavors, crafting a delightful symphony that awakens the senses and celebrates the dawn of a new day.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 4-6 Soft flour <em>or</em> corn tortillas</li>
        <li>6 Eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 pound cooked and crumbled bacon</li>
        <li>1 sliced avocado</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>A handful of fresh cilantro, finely chopped</li>
        <li>Salsa verde</li>
        <li>Sour cream</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Butter for cooking the eggs</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the Meat</strong> cook it in a skillet over medium heat until crisp. Drain on paper towels and then crumble or chop.</li>

        <li><strong>Scramble the Eggs</strong> In a bowl, whisk the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat, add a bit of butter or oil, and pour in the eggs. Gently scramble the eggs, stirring occasionally, until they are softly set. Remove from heat.</li> 

        <li><strong>Warm Tortillas</strong> Heat the tortillas in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 30 seconds on each side or until warm and pliable. Alternatively, wrap them in a damp cloth and microwave for 20-30 seconds.</li>

        <li><strong>Mix in Vegetables</strong> Add the mixed vegetables to the skillet and cook for another 2-3 minutes, just until they start to soften. Remove from heat.</li>

        <li><strong>Combine Creamy Elements</strong> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the condensed cream of mushroom soup and sour cream until smooth.</li>

        <li><strong>Combine Meat Mixture with Sauce</strong> Add the cooked meat and vegetable mixture to the bowl with the cream of mushroom and sour cream mixture. Stir until all ingredients are well combined.</li>

        <li><strong>Layer the Casserole</strong> In a large baking dish, spread the meat and vegetable mixture evenly on the bottom. Sprinkle 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese over the mixture.</li>

        <li><strong>Add Tater Tots</strong> Arrange the frozen tater tots in a single layer on top of the cheese. For a more refined appearance, line them up neatly in rows.</li>

        <li><strong>Bake</strong> Place the casserole in the preheated oven and bake for about 25 minutes, or until the tater tots are golden and crispy.</li>

        <li><strong>Add Final Cheese Layer</strong> Sprinkle the remaining cup of cheddar cheese over the tater tots and bake for an additional 5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>

        <li><strong>Garnish</strong> Remove the casserole from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Sprinkle with fresh herbs if using.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Serve</strong> Scoop portions onto plates, ensuring each has a share of the crispy tots, creamy middle layer, and meaty base.</li>
