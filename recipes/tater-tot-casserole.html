<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 pounds of ground beef</li>
        <li>1 medium onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 cup mixed vegetables</li>
        <li>1 can (10.5 oz) condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 package (32 oz) frozen tater tots</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Optional: Fresh herbs (such as parsley or chives)</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) to ensure it's ready for baking.</li>
        <li>Brown the Ground Beef: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook the ground beef, breaking it apart with a spoon, until it's no longer pink. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add Aromatics: Stir in the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet. Cook until the onion is translucent and aromatic, about 3-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix in Vegetables: Add the mixed vegetables to the skillet and cook for another 2-3 minutes, just until they start to soften. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Combine Creamy Elements: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the condensed cream of mushroom soup and sour cream until smooth.</li>
        <li>Combine Meat Mixture with Sauce: Add the cooked meat and vegetable mixture to the bowl with the cream of mushroom and sour cream mixture. Stir until all ingredients are well combined.</li>
        <li>Layer the Casserole: In a large baking dish, spread the meat and vegetable mixture evenly on the bottom. Sprinkle 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese over the mixture.</li>
        <li>Add Tater Tots: Arrange the frozen tater tots in a single layer on top of the cheese. For a more refined appearance, line them up neatly in rows.</li>
        <li>Bake: Place the casserole in the preheated oven and bake for about 25 minutes, or until the tater tots are golden and crispy.</li>
        <li>Add Final Cheese Layer: Sprinkle the remaining cup of cheddar cheese over the tater tots and bake for an additional 5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Garnish: Remove the casserole from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Sprinkle with fresh herbs if using.</li>
        <li>Serve: Scoop portions onto plates, ensuring each has a share of the crispy tots, creamy middle layer, and meaty base.</li>
