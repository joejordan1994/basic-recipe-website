<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 pounds of ground beef</li>
        <li>1 medium onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 cup mixed vegetables</li>
        <li>1 can (10.5 oz) condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 package (32 oz) frozen tater tots</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Optional: Fresh herbs (such as parsley or chives)</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven</strong> to 375°F (190°C) to ensure it's ready for baking.</li>

        <li><strong>Brown the Ground Beef</strong> In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook the ground beef, breaking it apart with a spoon, until it's no longer pink. Season with salt and pepper.</li>

        <li><strong>Add Aromatics</strong> Stir in the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet. Cook until the onion is translucent and aromatic, about 3-5 minutes.</li>

        <li><strong>Mix in Vegetables</strong> Add the mixed vegetables to the skillet and cook for another 2-3 minutes, just until they start to soften. Remove from heat.</li>

        <li><strong>Combine Creamy Elements</strong> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the condensed cream of mushroom soup and sour cream until smooth.</li>

        <li><strong>Combine Meat Mixture with Sauce</strong> Add the cooked meat and vegetable mixture to the bowl with the cream of mushroom and sour cream mixture. Stir until all ingredients are well combined.</li>

        <li><strong>Layer the Casserole</strong> In a large baking dish, spread the meat and vegetable mixture evenly on the bottom. Sprinkle 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese over the mixture.</li>

        <li><strong>Add Tater Tots</strong> Arrange the frozen tater tots in a single layer on top of the cheese. For a more refined appearance, line them up neatly in rows.</li>

        <li><strong>Bake</strong> Place the casserole in the preheated oven and bake for about 25 minutes, or until the tater tots are golden and crispy.</li>

        <li><strong>Add Final Cheese Layer</strong> Sprinkle the remaining cup of cheddar cheese over the tater tots and bake for an additional 5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>

        <li><strong>Garnish</strong> Remove the casserole from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Sprinkle with fresh herbs if using.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Serve</strong> Scoop portions onto plates, ensuring each has a share of the crispy tots, creamy middle layer, and meaty base.</li>
    </ol>
