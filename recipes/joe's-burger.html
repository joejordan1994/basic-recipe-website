<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Breakfast tacos represent an exquisite morning indulgence, where soft tortillas envelop a medley of fluffy scrambled eggs, crisped bacon or savory chorizo, and slices of creamy avocado. A sprinkle of aged cheddar or queso fresco introduces a touch of richness, while a drizzle of vibrant salsa or a dollop of sour cream adds a refreshing contrast. Each bite weaves together the simplicity of ingredients with a complexity of flavors, crafting a delightful symphony that awakens the senses and celebrates the dawn of a new day.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 4-6 Soft flour <em>or</em> corn tortillas</li>
        <li>6 Eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 pound cooked and crumbled bacon</li>
        <li>1 sliced avocado</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>A handful of fresh cilantro, finely chopped</li>
        <li>Salsa verde</li>
        <li>Sour cream</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Butter for cooking the eggs</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the meat</strong> in a skillet over medium heat until crisp. Drain on paper towels and then crumble or chop.</li>

        <li><strong>Scramble the eggs</strong> in a bowl, whisk the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat, add a bit of butter or oil, and pour in the eggs. Gently scramble the eggs, stirring occasionally, until they are softly set. Remove from heat.</li> 

        <li><strong>Warm the tortillas</strong> in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 30 seconds on each side or until warm and pliable. Alternatively, wrap them in a damp cloth and microwave for 20-30 seconds.</li>

        <li><strong>Fill the tortillas</strong> on a flat surface. Spoon the scrambled eggs evenly among the tortillas.</li>

        <li><strong>Add the toppings</strong> to the eggs with the cooked bacon or chorizo, slices of avocado, and a sprinkle of cheese.</li>

        <li><strong>Garnish</strong> with a dollop of sour cream and a drizzle of salsa on top. If desired, garnish with fresh cilantro or chives for an added burst of flavor and color.</li>

        <li><strong>Enjoy immediately</strong> while they are warm and fresh, with additional salsa and sour cream on the side for extra flavor.</li>
