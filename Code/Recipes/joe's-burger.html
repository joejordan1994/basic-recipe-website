    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Imagine a burger, not just any burger, but a culinary jewel perfect for
      dinner. At its core, a beef patty, seasoned and grilled to a tender yet
      crisp finish, cradled by a toasted artisan brioche bun that whispers
      buttery notes. Melting over the beef, a slice of aged cheese adds a layer
      of creamy luxury. Fresh lettuce and a ripe tomato slice introduce a crisp
      freshness, contrasted by a smear of gourmet sauce that ties the flavors
      together in a tangy embrace. This burger blends warmth and coolness,
      richness and brightness, creating a harmonious dining experience. It's an
      elegant choice for dinner, transforming the ordinary into an occasion,
      inviting one to indulge in a masterpiece of flavors and textures with
      every bite.

      <li>Fresh Lettuce - 1 leaf</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Season</strong> the beef patty with salt and pepper to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Preheat</strong> a grill or skillet over medium-high heat. Cook
        the patty to your desired level of doneness, about 3-4 minutes per side
        for medium-rare.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>While the patty cooks,</strong> spread butter on the cut sides
        of the brioche bun and lightly toast it on the grill or skillet until
        golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>As the patty finishes cooking,</strong> place a slice of aged
        cheese on top to melt.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>On the bottom half of the toasted brioche bun,</strong> place a
        leaf of fresh lettuce and a slice of ripe tomato.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Once the cheese has melted,</strong> transfer the beef patty
        onto the bed of lettuce and tomato.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spread your choice</strong> of gourmet sauce on the top half of
        the brioche bun.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cover the burger</strong> with the top half of the bun, press
        gently, and serve immediately.
